# dailyHtml
Code sample for a html section that changes depending on which day the user is browsing the page.

## scope of works
Created during a build this sample allows the user to edit files dedicated to each day of the week, from our root folder we have an asset folder containing Html, Stylesheets and Scripts. This allows us to have files stored away from where the content will be displayed.
